## Angular 

First, create an empty project with Angular CLI. You **must** add Angular routing for this schematic to work.

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
ng new secure-angular --routing
cd secure-angular
```

Then, integrate your Angular app with [Okta](#okta-for-angular) or [Auth0](#auth0-for-angular).

### Okta for Angular

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com).
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`.
3. Choose **Single Page App** and use `http://localhost:4200/callback` for the Redirect URI.

In your `secure-angular` project, add `@oktadev/schematics`:

```
ng add @oktadev/schematics
```

Use the values that the Okta CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted.

Run `npm start`, open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser, and sign in. ðŸ¥³

See the [Okta Angular SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-angular) for more information.

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

* Log in to your Okta instance (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one). Go to **Applications** > **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Single-Page Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add `http://localhost:4200/callback` as a Sign-in redirect URI and `http://localhost:4200` as a Sign-out redirect URI.
* Specify `http://localhost:4200` as a Trusted Origin and click **Save**.

### Auth0 for Angular

1. Install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli).
