## Angular 

First, create an empty project with Angular CLI. You **must** add Angular routing for this schematic to work.

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
ng new secure-angular --routing
cd secure-angular
```

### Add an OpenID Connect App in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com).
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`.
3. Choose **Single Page App** and use `http://localhost:4200/callback` for the Redirect URI.

In your `secure-angular` project, add `@oktadev/schematics`:

```
ng add @oktadev/schematics
```

Use the values that the Okta CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted.

Run `npm start`, open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser, and sign in. ðŸ¥³

See the [Okta Angular SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-angular) for more information.

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

* Log in to your Okta instance (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one). Go to **Applications** > **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Single-Page Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add `http://localhost:4200/callback` as a Login redirect URI and `http://localhost:4200` as a Logout redirect URI.
* Specify `http://localhost:4200` as a Trusted Origin and click **Save**.

## Angular + Auth0

First, create an empty project with Angular CLI. You **must** add Angular routing for this schematic to work.

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
ng new secure-angular --routing
cd secure-angular
```

### Add an OpenID Connect App in Auth0

1. Install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli).
2. Run `auth0 login` to register your account, followed by `auth0 apps create`.
3. Specify a name and description of your choosing.
4. Select **Single Page Web Application** and use `http://localhost:4200/home` for the Callback URLs.
5. Use `http://localhost:4200` for the rest of the URLs.

In your `secure-angular` project, add `@oktadev/schematics` with the `--auth0` flag:

```
ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0
```

Use the values that the Auth0 CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted. 

Run `npm start`, open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser, and sign in. ðŸ¤©

See the [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) for more information.

You can also use the Auth0 Console:

* Choose **Single Page Web Applications** as the application type and click **Create**.
* Click **Angular**, then the **Settings** tab.
* Add `http://localhost:4200/home` as an Allowed Callback URL and `http://localhost:4200` as a Logout URL.
* Specify `http://localhost:4200` as an Allowed Origin and click **Save Changes** at the bottom.

## React

Create a new project with Create React App.

```
npx create-react-app secure-react
cd secure-react
```

If you'd like to use TypeScript, add the `--template typescript` flag.

```
npx create-react-app secure-react --template typescript
cd secure-react
```

### Add an OpenID Connect App in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`
3. Choose **Single Page App** and use `http://localhost:3000/callback` for the Redirect URI

Install the Schematics CLI globally.

```
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

Then install and run the `add-auth` schematic in your `secure-react` project.

```
npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth
```

Use the values that the Okta CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted.

Run `npm start`, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and sign in. ðŸŽ‰

See the [Okta React SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-react) for more information.

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

* Log in to your Okta instance (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one). Go to **Applications** > **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Single-Page Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a Login redirect URI and `http://localhost:3000` as a Logout redirect URI.
* Add `http://localhost:3000` as a Trusted Origin and click **Save**.

## Vue

Create a new project with Vue CLI. You **must** add routing for this schematic to work. If you specify TypeScript, a `src/router/index.ts` will be used.

```
npm i -g @vue/cli
vue create secure-vue
cd secure-vue
```

### Add an OpenID Connect App in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`
3. Choose **Single Page App** and use `http://localhost:8080/callback` for the Redirect URI

Install the Schematics CLI globally.

```
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

Then install and run the `add-auth` schematic in your `secure-vue` project.

```
npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth
```

Use the values that the Okta CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted.

Run `npm run serve`, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser, and sign in. ðŸ’¥

See the [Okta Vue SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-vue) for more information.

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

* Log in to your Okta instance (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one). Go to **Applications** > **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Single-Page Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add `http://localhost:8080/callback` as a Login redirect URI and `http://localhost:8080` as a Logout redirect URI.
* Add `http://localhost:8080` as a Trusted Origin and click **Save**.

## Ionic

Create a new Ionic + Angular project with Ionic CLI. You **must** use the `tabs` layout for everything to work currently. 

```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
ionic start secure-ionic tabs --type=angular --no-interactive
cd secure-ionic
```

You will need an `issuer` and a `clientId` to begin. You can obtain those from Okta by completing the following steps.

> **NOTE:** OIDC Login for Ionic is possible thanks to the excellent [Ionic AppAuth](https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth#readme) project and its examples. This integration is not Okta-specific and should work with any identity provider that supports PKCE for browser and mobile apps.

### Create an Application in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`
3. Choose **Native** and use `[com.okta.dev-133337:/callback,http://localhost:8100/callback]` for the Login redirect URIs (where `dev-133337.okta.com` is your Okta domain)
4. Use `[com.okta.dev-133337:/logout,http://localhost:8100/logout]` for the Logout redirect URIs

In your `secure-ionic` project, add `@oktadev/schematics`:

```
ng add @oktadev/schematics
```

Use the values that the Okta CLI provides for the issuer and client ID when prompted.

**NOTE:** You can switch to Cordova by passing in `--platform=cordova`. The default is Capacitor.

Start your app and authenticate with Okta. ðŸŽ‰

```
ionic serve
```

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

Log in to your Okta instance (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don't have an account).

From the **Applications** page, choose **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**. Select **Native Application**. 

Give your app a memorable name, and configure it as follows:

* Login redirect URIs:
  * `http://localhost:8100/callback`
  * `com.okta.dev-133337:/callback` (where `dev-133337.okta.com` is your Okta domain)
* Logout redirect URIs:
  * `http://localhost:8100/logout`
  * `com.okta.dev-133337:/logout`
* Trusted Origins:
  * `http://localhost:8100`
* Click **Save**

### iOS

If you ran `ng add @oktadev/schematics` without a `--platform` parameter, your project has been configured for Capacitor. Build and add Capacitor for iOS with the following commands:

```
ionic build
npm i @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios
```

Add your custom scheme to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.getcapacitor.capacitor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>capacitor</string>
      <string>com.okta.dev-133337</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Then, run your project using the Capacitor CLI:

```
npx cap run ios
```

You can also open your project in Xcode and configure code signing.

```
npx cap open ios
```

Then run your app from Xcode.

### iOS and Cordova

If you want to use Cordova, you **must** integrate this library with `ng add @oktadev/schematics --platform=cordova`.

Then, generate a native project with the following command:

```
ionic cordova prepare ios
```

Open your project in Xcode, configure code signing, and run your app.

```
open platforms/ios/MyApp.xcworkspace
```

### Android

If you ran `ng add @oktadev/schematics` without a `--platform` parameter, your project has been configured for Capacitor. Build and add Capacitor for Android with the following commands:

```
ionic build
npm i @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
```

Add your reverse domain name as the `android:scheme` in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` by adding another `<intent-filter>` above the existing one in the `<activity>` element.

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="com.okta.dev-133337" />
</intent-filter>
```

The [SafariViewController Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller) is installed as part of this project. Capacitor uses AndroidX dependencies, but the SafariViewController plugin uses an older non-AndroidX dependency. Use [jetifier](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier) to [patch usages of old support libraries](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android/troubleshooting#error-package-android-support-does-not-exist) with the following commands:

```
npm install jetifier
npx jetify
npx cap sync android
```

Then, run your project using the Capacitor CLI:

```
npx cap run android
```

You can also open your project in Android Studio and run your app.

```
npx cap open android
```

### Android and Cordova

If you want to use Cordova, you **must** add this library with `ng add @oktadev/schematics --platform=cordova`.

Then, generate a native project with the following command:

```
ionic cordova prepare android
```

Set the launchMode to `singleTask` so the URL does not trigger a new instance of the app in `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
android:launchMode="singleTask"
```

Open `platforms/android` in Android Studio and run your app.

If you get a Gradle error in Android Studio, go to **File** > **Project Structure** and change the Android Gradle Plugin to `4.0.1`. Kudos to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63206864).

See [Ionic's iOS](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios) and [Android Development](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android) docs for more information.

## React Native

Create a new React Native project with the React Native CLI. 

```
npx react-native init SecureApp
```

You will need an `issuer` and a `clientId` to begin. You can obtain those from Okta by completing the following steps.

### Create an Application in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`
3. Choose **Native** and accept the default Redirect URI of `com.okta.dev-133337:/callback` (where `dev-133337.okta.com` is your Okta domain)
4. Use `com.okta.dev-133337:/logout` for the Post Logout Redirect URI

Install the Schematics CLI globally.

```
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

Install and run the `add-auth` schematic in your `SecureApp` project. 

```
cd SecureApp
npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth --issuer=$issuer --clientId=$clientId
```

You can also use the Okta Admin Console:

* Log in to your Okta instance (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one). Go to **Applications** > **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Native** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add `com.okta.dev-133337:/callback` as a Login redirect URI and `com.okta.dev-133337:/callback` as a Logout redirect URI (where `dev-133337.okta.com` is your Okta domain).

### iOS

Run `pod install --project-directory=ios --repo-update` to install the [Okta OIDC iOS SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios).

Start your app and authenticate with Okta. ðŸŽ‰

```
npm run ios
```

### Android

One change is made to Android build files to integrate the [Okta OIDC Android SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android). 

* In `android/app/build.gradle`, an `appAuthRedirectScheme` is added in `android` > `defaultConfig`.

Since this modification is done for you, you can simply start your app and authenticate with Okta. ðŸŽŠ

```
npm run android
```

For more information, see the [Okta React Native SDK documentation](https://github.com/okta/okta-react-native#readme).

## Express

Create a new project with express-generator and pug.

```
mkdir express-app
cd express-app
npx express-generator --view=pug
```

### Add an OpenID Connect App in Okta

1. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
2. Run `okta register` to create an account, followed by `okta apps create`
3. Choose **Web** > **Other** and use `http://localhost:3000/callback` for the Redirect URI
4. Accept the default Post Logout Redirect URI (`http://localhost:3000`)

Install the Schematics CLI globally.

```
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

Then install and run the `add-auth` schematic in your `express-app` project. 

The Okta CLI will create an `.okta.env` file in the current directory. It will have the values you need. After you use them in the command below, you can delete this file.

```
npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth --issuer=$issuer \
  --clientId=$clientId --clientSecret=$clientSecret
```

ðŸš¨ This process will create an `.env` file will be generated with your Okta credentials. Make sure to add `*.env` to `.gitignore` and don't check it into source control!

Start your app and authenticate with Okta at `http://localhost:3000`. ðŸŽŠ

```
npm start
```

See the [Okta OIDC Middleware SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/oidc-middleware#readme) for more information.

You can also create your app using the Okta Admin Console:

* Log into the Okta Developer Dashboard (or [create an account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you don't have one), click **Applications** then **Create App Integration** > **OIDC**.
* Choose **Web** as the application type and click **Next**.
* Add a Login redirect URI of `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
* Add a Logout redirect URI of `http://localhost:3000`.
* Click **Save**.

## Testing

This project supports unit tests and integration tests.

`npm test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

`./test-app.sh angular` will create an Angular project with Angular CLI, install this project, and make sure all the project's tests pass. Other options include `react`, `react-ts`, `vue`, `vue-ts`, `ionic`, `ionic-cordova`, `react-native`, and `express`.

`./test-all.sh` will test all the options: Angular, React, React with TypeScript, Vue, Vue with TypeScript, Ionic with Cordova, Ionic with Capacitor, React Native, and Express.

## Publishing

To publish, simply do:

```bash
npm publish
```

That's it!

## Contributing

If you'd like to modify this library, and contribute your changes, you can start by forking it to your own GitHub repository. Then, clone it to your hard drive.

```
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/schematics.git
cd schematics
```

Create a new branch for your changes:

```
git checkout -b my-awesome-branch
```

Make the changes you want to make and add tests where appropriate. Create a new project with whatever framework you're using, then run the following command inside it to use your modified project.

```
npm link /path/to/schematics
```

You'll need to run `npm run build` whenever you change anything in the schematics project.

**NOTE:** You can also use `npm pack` in your schematics project, then `npm install /path/to/artifact.tar.gz` in your test project. This mimics `npm install` more than `npm link`.
